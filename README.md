## What you should know about openEuler.

### 💁 What is it?
OpenEuler is an open-source operating system designed for digital infrastructure. Here, anyone can freely *access*, *modify*, and *distribute* its source code. In the era of the digital economy, openEuler will facilitate the operation of 5G, big data, cloud, etc.<br />

### 👀 Where it can be used?
* various devices: **servers**, **cloud computing**, **edge computing**, **embedded**, etc
* all-scenario applications: ***i*nformation technology (IT)**, ***c*omunication technology (CT)**, ***o*perational technology (OT)**, etc.

### 👍 What's its advantange?
* **Real-time Kernel Support**: In addition to the Linux kernel, openEuler provides a real-time kernel, which makes it stand out from traditional systems.
* **Expanded Application Scenario Coverage**: OpenEuler now covers a wider range of application scenarios.
* **Unified Development Environment**: OpenEuler offers unified development views and interfaces.
* **Seamless Software Migration**: OpenEuler facilitates the migration of software and applications between different systems.
* **Enhanced Collaboration Across Domains**: OpenEuler improves collaboration among the device, edge side, and cloud side.
* **Lowered Development Barriers and Fostered Application Ecosystem Prosperity**: OpenEuler reduces development barriers while fostering the prosperity of the application ecosystem.

### 💭 What's its blueprint?
* **Technology**:
  * explore diverse computing capabilities
  * create operating systems for diverse computing scenarios
  * provide support at the system and toolchain's foundational levels
* **Team**:
  * cultivate a talent pool with expertise in open source, infrastructure, and system architecture
* **Community**:
  * optimize community organization
  * establish a sound and sustainable structure
* **Globalization**:
  * offer high-level, world-class software
  * foster international collaboration with global partners and communities

## 🏃 Now, embark on your Journey.
For most users, click [here](https://www.openeuler.org/en/) to start. <br />
For engineers, the [archive](https://www.openeuler.org/en/download/archive/) is also available. <br/>

<div align=center>
<img src="https://github.com/Jintiannn/OpenEuler_/blob/main/image/Download_Archive.png" width="900">
</div>

Moving the cursor to [Developers](https://www.openeuler.org/en/) on the menu bar, you can see a drop-down list box. From here you can join our team as 
developers.</p>

<div align=center>

</div>

As a starter, it's normal that you may have some difficulty in handling so much information altogether. Yet following our simple steps, soon you'll be more familiar with this community.

### ✒️ Sign Contributor License Agreement (CLA) first.
> Open source may indicate freedom, yet it not equals to freedom.

As people's abiding by the laws and regulations are of paramount importance in the development of a community, anyone who are eager to join openEuler shall sign CLA first.

On the left corner of the box lies a link to sign the [CIA](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign/gitee_openeuler-1611298811283968340).

<div align=center>
<img src="https://github.com/Jintiannn/OpenEuler_/blob/main/image/circled.png" width="900">
</div>

**For most users:**
* Click [Sign Employee CIA](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign-cla) if you have signed the CLA as an employee of a company that has signed the CLA.
* Click [Sign Individual CIA](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign-cla) if you are an independent developer or your company has not signed the enterprise CIA with the community.</p>

### 👥 Join a Group.

Various special interest groups (SIG) constitute the community. **Here you have two options:**
* **Find and apply for groups where you share the same unique interest.** <br />
Find the [existing SIG](https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/tree/master/sig).<br />
* **Apply for creating one when yours is niche, so that others can find and join you!** <br />
Read [how the Technical Committee (TC) manage SIG](https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/tree/master/zh/technical-committee/governance).</p>

### 😯 What can I do?

With CIA signed and group joined or created, it’s time for you to think about what you can do to the community. Basically it can be concluded into four types.</p>
**1.🔎 Finding Bugs/Offering Improvements.** <br />
*experience--→find questions--→report to the community (with instructive suggestions)* <br />
In the community, we use the 'issue' system for reporting concerns. Before submission, contributors specify the relevant 'repo' (usually referred to as a repository) where the issue belongs. For example, the Linux operating system's 'kernel' has its own 'repo' for efficient issue management.</p>

**2.💪 Fixing Bugs.** <br />
Within the community, we typically encourage not only identifying issues but also providing solutions. When you raise an issue, it would be better if you can also offer a patch.</p>

**3.📦 Contributing Software Packages.** Helping Fill Missing Software Packages for openEuler.<br />
**Before that, developers need to grasp two fundamental concepts:** <br />
* Understanding what a Linux software package is, or how the Linux operating system is organized.<br />
* Knowing how to create a software package.</p>

**4.💡 Developing New Software.** Creating a brand-new software based on your ideas and contributing it to the openEuler community, becoming a part of the openEuler distribution.<br />
**There are two methods to integrate your work into the openEuler community:** <br />
* **Develop in Other Communities and Integrate into openEuler:** Assuming you already have your project on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Gitee, you only need to follow the third participation method to add the software to the 'src-openeuler' repo.<br />
* **Develop within our Community and Integrate in openEuler.** Or you can establish your project on [Gitee](https://gitee.com/openeuler), like 'hosting' your project within the openEuler community.</p>

Finally, we extend a heartfelt welcome to everyone to join our community. With the openEuler platform, let’s come together to create a richer, more intelligent world.<br />
