### 👍 What's its advantage?
* `expanded application scenario coverage`
* `unified development views and interfaces`
* `real-time kernel support apart from Linux`
* `enhanced collaboration among device, edge side, and cloud side`
* `seamless software migration and applications between different systems`
* `lowered development barriers and fostered application ecosystem prosperity`

### 💭 What's its blueprint?
* **Team**:
  * cultivate expertise in open source, infrastructure, and system architecture
* **Community**:
  * optimize community organization
  * establish a sound and sustainable structure
* **Technology**:
  * create versatile operating systems
  * provide foundational support in systems and toolchains

## 🏃 Now, Embark on Your Journey in OpenEuler.

For most users, click [here](https://www.openeuler.org/en/) to start. <br />
For engineers, you can also visit our [archive](https://www.openeuler.org/en/download/archive/) for downloads. <br/>

</div>

Move the cursor to [Developers](https://www.openeuler.org/en/) in the menu bar. You will see a drop-down list box, where you can join our team as a developer.</p>

</div>

As a starter, it's normal if you have some difficulty in handling so much information altogether. Yet following our simple steps, soon you'll be more familiar with the community.

### ✒️ Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) first.
> Open source may imply freedom, but it does not necessarily equate to freedom.

As abiding by laws and regulations is of paramount importance in the development of a community, anyone who is eager to join openEuler shall sign a CLA first.

In the left corner of the box, you'll see a link to sign the [CLA](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign/gitee_openeuler-1611298811283968340).

<div align=center>
<img src="https://github.com/Jintiannn/OpenEuler_/blob/main/image/circled.png" width="900">
</div>

**For most users:**
* Click [Sign Employee CLA](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign-cla) if you have signed the CLA as an employee of a company that has signed the CLA.
* Click [Sign Individual CLA](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign-cla) if you are an independent developer or your company has not signed the enterprise CLA with the community.</p>

### 👥 Join a group.

Various special interest groups (SIG) constitute the community. Here you have two options:
* **Find and apply for groups where you share the same interests.** <br />
[Find the existing SIG](https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/tree/master/sig).<br />
* **Apply to create one when yours is a niche so that others can find and join you!** <br />
[Read how the Technical Committee (TC) manages SIG](https://gitee.com/openeuler/community/tree/master/zh/technical-committee/governance).</p>

### 😯 What can I do?

With the CLA signed and your group joined or created, it's time to consider your contributions to the community. Here are four basic steps, which you can take one by one.</p>

**1.🔎 Find bugs (and offer improvements if possible):** <br />
You can: *experience--→identify issues--→pose questions--→report them to the community (with instructive suggestions)* <br />
In the community, we use the 'issue' system for reporting concerns. When submitting, contributors should specify the relevant 'repo' (repository) to which the issue pertains. For example, the 'kernel' of the Linux operating system has its own repo dedicated to efficient issue management.</p>

**2.💪 Fix bugs:** <br />
Fixing bugs in the community takes your involvement to the next level, essentially embracing the developer's role. Here, we encourage not just spotting issues but also contributing solutions. Ideally, when you come across a problem, it's a great practice to offer a patch as a solution right away.</p>

**3.📦 Contribute software packages:** 
Help out by adding software packages if you notice something's missing.<br />
**Before diving in, here are two key things developers need to get a handle on:** <br />
  * Understand what a Linux software package is, or how the Linux operating system is structured.<br />
  * Know how to create a software package.</p>

**4.💡 Develop new software:** 
Create brand-new software based on your ideas and contribute it to the openEuler community, making it part of the openEuler distribution.<br />
**You have the flexibility to choose one of two methods to integrate your work into the openEuler community:** <br />
  * **Develop in other communities and integrate into openEuler:** If you already have your project on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Gitee, you can follow the third participation method to add the software to the 'src-openeuler' repo.<br />
  * **Develop within our community and integrate into openEuler:** Alternatively, you can establish your project on [openEuer](https://gitee.com/openeuler), which is similar to 'hosting' your project within the openEuler community.</p>

Finally, we extend a heartfelt welcome to everyone to join our community❤️. With the openEuler platform, let’s come together to create a richer and more intelligent world.<br />
